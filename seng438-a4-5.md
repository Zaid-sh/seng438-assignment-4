# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class


# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

The Datautilities test suite did not increase the mutation score because it had a 90% score from the beginning. This was close to the limit of mutation coverage because of equivalent mutants capping the possible coverage.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
The test cases were designed by first considering the website's basic functionalities, such as adding/removing products from the cart, being able to sign in, and changing locations. After we discussed more intricate features that could be tested, we built on the basic functionalities, such as adding multiple quantities of one item into the cart, the search quality, and the coupon functionality. The test cases were created to ensure that they worked regardless of changes in the website, such as new trending products, not using the shortcuts for searching, etc.

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
Assertions were used to detect if the selenium tests were functioning as expected through checking if the element displayed was correct, the correct button was clicked, etc. Confirming conditions like element presence, text correctness, or the correct URL helps ensure that a test case is operating as intended.  Depending on the type of assertion used, the test may either end or proceed if an assertion fails. Furthermore, the selenium test cases we developed utilized different types of assertions to validate the test cases.

# How did you test each functionaity with different test data
We had 8 test cases in our Selenium tests: Add multiple quantities to cart, add and remove, add an item to cart, change location, load coupons, login and logout, search item, and sign in. Most test cases were designed by simply navigating to the correct product and clicking add to cart. For example, for the add and remove test, we click a product, add it to the cart, navigate to the cart, and click to remove button. Other test cases require text input, such as the login and logout, which will use an already existing account to log in and then navigate to the logout button in the navigation menu. Many methods were used to accurately test the functionalities of the different test cases.

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
A popular automation tool, Selenium has a strong community, extensive documentation, and cross-browser compatibility.  It supports a number of programming languages, including Java, Python, and JavaScript, and saves time by automating tests. However,  It is restricted to webpages and occasionally has trouble recognizing features on responsive designs.

SikuliX, on the other hand, uses picture recognition for automation and can run on any GUI on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Its language support is restricted to Python 2.7, Ruby, JavaScript, and certain Java-based languages, despite the fact that it provides versatility beyond online applications.  Furthermore, saved photos might match more than one element, which could lead to inconsistent test execution.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab was nice because it demonstrated how to use a method to automatically test GUI's which is more variable than normal code. It was challenging in the fact where you needed to figure out how to get more mutation coverage from tests that weren't initially designed for mutation testing. It was also difficult because sselenium was not available on chrome so edge or firefox had to be downloaded to make the GUI tests.
