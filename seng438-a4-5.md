# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class


# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
The test cases were designed by first considering the website's basic functionalities, such as adding/removing products from the cart, being able to sign in, and changing locations. After we discussed more intricate features that could be tested, we built on the basic functionalities, such as adding multiple quantities of one item into the cart, the search quality, and the coupon functionality. The test cases were created to ensure that they worked regardless of changes in the website, such as new trending products, not using the shortcuts for searching, etc.

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
Assertions were used to detect if the selenium tests were functioning as expected through checking if the element displayed was correct, the correct button was clicked, etc. Confirming conditions like element presence, text correctness, or the correct URL helps ensure that a test case is operating as intended.  Depending on the type of assertion used, the test may either end or proceed if an assertion fails. Furthermore, the selenium test cases we developed utilized different types of assertions to validate the test cases.

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data


# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
A popular automation tool, Selenium has a strong community, extensive documentation, and cross-browser compatibility.  It supports a number of programming languages, including Java, Python, and JavaScript, and saves time by automating tests. However,  It is restricted to webpages and occasionally has trouble recognizing features on responsive designs.

SikuliX, on the other hand, uses picture recognition for automation and can run on any GUI on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Its language support is restricted to Python 2.7, Ruby, JavaScript, and certain Java-based languages, despite the fact that it provides versatility beyond online applications.  Furthermore, saved photos might match more than one element, which could lead to inconsistent test execution.
