# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

The Datautilities test suite did not increase the mutation score because it had a 90% score from the beginning. This was close to the limit of mutation coverage because of equivalent mutants capping the possible coverage. 

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
The lab was nice because it demonstrated how to use a method to automatically test GUI's which is more variable than normal code. It was challenging in the fact where you needed to figure out how to get more mutation coverage from tests that weren't initially designed for mutation testing. It was also difficult because sselenium was not available on chrome so edge or firefox had to be downloaded to make the GUI tests.
